<h1> <b> About the Author - Krishna Bambawale</b></h1>

<p>Krishna Bambawale is currently a Grade 10 student at the well-known Canadian private school, Upper Canada College, and is on the path to be an influential figure, who will leave a permanent impact on the world. Over the last several years, Krishna has lived in London, England, Philadelphia, United States, and currently, he resides in Toronto, Canada. Through living in each of these diverse places, he has learned important fundamentals of how to adapt to new societies, and how to be culturally sensitive to those around him. In addition, he has achieved the highest levels of academic excellence in each of his schools, pursued various entrepreneurial ventures with passion in the technology, finance and commerce industries, networked extensively with professionals of all ages in multiple industries, interned at banks, non-profit organizations and marketing firms, and has participated in numerous business competitions.
 
Krishna has continually, from a young age, displayed what he is passionate about, and is working hard to ensure he is able to achieve his career goals. A few of these passions are business and private equity. In the summer of 2018, he took a Financial Accounting course online by the Wharton School and a Private Equity/Venture Capital course online by Bocconi University, in which he was both successful. In that same summer, Krishna briefly interned at one of India’s private banks, Citi Bank, where he focused on Foreign Exchange fundamentals/markets as well as Product Insurance to further his knowledge in each of those fields. In the latter months of 2017, Krishna co-founded PowrPac, a company that sells unique 2 in 1, environmentally friendly battery packs, with two of his colleagues, through the Junior Achievement Company Program. Asides from being a pioneer of PowrPac and leader of his group, Krishna was also the Chief Financial Officer of the company. Because of his many valued contributions, where he went above and beyond his call of duty, Krishna was recognized by the Junior Achievement Company Program of Central Ontario as a select finalist for the Junior Achievement Financial Officer of the Year Award. Also, his months of work directly propelled PowrPac to the Marketing and Advertising award at VentureON, where they beat out 49 other start-ups. In June of 2018, Krishna attended the first National High School Business Competiton at Deloitte University in Toronto and captained his team to 3rd place, a remarkable finish for the youngest participating team. As the Fall of 2018 commenced, Krishna was chosen to be a National High School Ambassador of both Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) and the Junior Achievement Company Program in Central Ontario. Most recently, Krishna was rewarded with Upper Canada College’s most outstanding accolade for academics, an Academic Tie, and spot on The Principal’s List, for having a cumulative average in the top 5% and top 10%, respectively, out of his class of 162 boys. Krishna believes that if he continues to expand his growth-mindset and work as hard as possible, he will be successful in achieving his several 5 and 10-year goals.
