<p> After 14 blistering seasons in the most competitive hockey league in the world and finally winning his much deserved Stanley Cup, it is without any doubt whatsoever that... <b>Alex Ovechkin, </b> the longtime captain of the Washington Capitals, is the best player in the NHL. Some of his many accolades include winning the Calder Memorial Trophy in his mesmerizing rookie season, being a one time Art Ross Trophy winner, a three time Hart Trophy winner, a Conn Smythe Trophy winner and most notably, a 7 time Maurice "the Rocket" Richard Trophy winner for leading the league in goals during the regular season. Throughout his career with 1047 games played he has an incredible 639 goals and 533 assists (1172 pts total). During the 2018/2019 NHL season, he has 32 goals and 18 assists (50 pts total) through 44 games, good for 22nd in the league, as of January 13, 2019. More recently, Ovechkin was selected as the captain of the Metropolitan Division for the third time in the previous four years, but decided to boldy skip the game and face a one game suspension in an effort to gain additional rest before second half playoff push to conclude the season. </p>
